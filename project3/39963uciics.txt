hi
making
accurate
computer
models
platonic
archimedean
solids
extent
possible
like
use
nice
constants
generating
basic
metaphor
approach
lay
plane
figure
folded
will
yield
desired
polyhedron
describing
polygons
relationships
straightforward
16
18
models
remaining
facts
necessary
namely
dihedral
angles
pi
fold
angles
also
nice
number
example
arcsin
sqrt
6
3
like
never
mind
precisely
managed
discover
nice
way
expressing
angles
snub
cube
requires
two

addition
although
understand

work
define
snub

snub

still
looking
simple
way
create

also
ask
anyone
seen
recipe
creating
two
perplexing

discussion
will
need
define
pairs
corresponding
points

hand
points
better
morph
generally
simplest
way
probably
use
cpselect
tool
write
little
tool
using
ginput
plot
commands
hold
hold
now
need
provide
triangulation
points
will
used
morphing
can
compute
triangulation
way
like
even
define
hand
delaunay
triangulation
see
delaunay
related
functions
good
choice
since
produce
overly
skinny
triangles
can
compute
delaunay
triangulation
either
point
sets
triangulation
throughout
morph
best
approach
probably
compute
triangulation
midway
shape
mean
two
point
sets
lessen
potential
triangle
deformations
order
get
nice
looking
results
will
probably
want
click
lots
corresponding

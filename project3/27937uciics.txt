2
writing
python
programs
today's
exercise
yesterday
lecture
wrote
short
python
program
counted
number
nucleotides
dna
sequence
morning
opportunity
write
short
python
programs
first
though
need
teach
couple
new
things
pair
optional
tuesday's
section
feel
free
pair
making
optional
today
may
find
experience
goes
lot
smoothly
someone
bounce
ideas
pair
work
way
tuesday
one
computer
shared
two
one
person
driving
watching
keyboard
changing
hands
least
every
fifteen
minutes
writing
program
outside
interpreter
window
one
frustration
faced
lecture
yesterday
problem
retyping
complete
program
interpreter
just
one
mistake
minor
issue
class
since
program
writing
short
imagine
program
8
000
lines
long
instead
8
painful
indeed
make
changes
8
000
line
program
necessary
retype
even
copy
paste
interpreter
every
time
besides
usually
want
able
keep
programs
write
can
use
later
type
interpreter
window
programs
die
soon
shut
interpreter
idle
provides
easy
effective
solution
problems
allows
write
program
separate
window
editing
much
like
saving
hard
drive
external
drive
like
usb
drive
periodically
whenever
like
run
program
can
send
python
interpreter
automatically
type
want
start
writing
program
first
start
idle
go
file
menu
select
new
window
new
empty
window
initially
called
untitled
will
pop
result
call
window
editor
window
since
editing
program
editor
window
can
write
python
program
along
way
save
periodically
can
going
new
window's
file
menu
selecting
save
try
typing
short
program
yesterday's
lecture
type
copy
paste
like
see
editor
window
behaves
move
one
line
next
notice
particular
automatically
indents
lines
note
indentation
just
used
make
programs
pretty
python
actually
requirement
language
affects
program's
meaning
program
prints
number
a's

acount
line
begins
character
called
comment
note
write
benefit
others
read
program
python
will
purposefully
ignore
can
put
comments
anywhere
like
type
line
rest
line
will
ignored
python
might
good
write
brief
comment
top
programs
explaining
purpose
may
need
refer
programs
later
course
done
typing
program
want
run
go

assignment
will
extend
field
view
camera
forming
mosaic
multiple
photographs
images
taken
optical
center
can
aligned
homography
transformation
estimate
homography
need
4
pairs
corresponding
points
overlap
region
mark
points
manually
discussed
class
methods
finding
automatically
following
directory
contains
source
images
alignment
along
code
get
started
downloads
programming
75
points
warping
50
points
first
image
example
provided
central
image
simplest
construct
mosaic
central
image
set
peripheral
images
since
need
find
just
one
homography
peripheral
image
use
cpselect
cpcorr
functions
manually
select
refine
least
4
pairs
corresponding
points
overlap
region
central
peripheral
images
points
located
high
contrast
corners
next
compute
homography
using
linear
least
squares
set
correspondences
provide
mapping
points
central
images
points
peripheral
images
probably
want
write
two
functions
function
computehomography
x1
y1
x2
y2
function
x2
y2
applyhomography
x1
y1
note
inverse
mapping
given
simply
inv
use
central
image's
coordinate
system
final
mosaic
need
figure
min
max
pixel
coordinates
peripheral
images
mapped
central
image's
coordinate
system
simply
apply
homographies
peripheral
images'
corner
points
find
extent
final
mosaic
now
generate
meshgrid
points
cover
extent
final
mosaic
apply
inverse
homography
turn
map
back
source
images
using
interp2
extract
pixel
values
source
images
input
image
produces
image
size
final
mosaic
pixels
outside
source
image
set
nan
blending
25
points
finally
assemble
mosaic
remapped
source
images
use
isnan
get
mask
one
tells
pixels
valid
invalid
simplest
approach
just
paste
pixels
image
turn
however
discussed
class
can
lead
bad
artifacts
instead
create
blend
images
construct
mosaic
sequentially
time
adding
photo
existing
mosaic
ever
deal
blending
new
photo
mosaic
however
will
still
take
creative
thought
part
figure
nice
way
perform
weighted
blend
pairs
images
overlap
will
probably
want
refer
back
lecture
9
ideas
receive
full
credit
must
implement
type
weighted
blending
will
award
15
extra
credit
anyone
implements
2
band
laplacian
pyramid
blending
writeup
25
points
show
resulting
mosaic
one
provided
examples
also
show
individual
remapped
source
images
warped
blended
together
final
mosaic
show
two
mosaics
creation
least
3
source

use
camera
take
images
remember
want
keep
camera
center
location
simply
rotate
camera

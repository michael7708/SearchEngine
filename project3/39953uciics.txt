hi
sa'ndor
beautiful
phantasy
stirring
especially
b1
coin
name
rhombic
triacosiohedron
since
300
congruent
rhombic
faces
golden
ones
suppose
addition
altogether
600
edges
280
vertices
thus
euler
characteristic
chi
equals
20
consequently
genus
1
2
2
chi
equals
11
means
topologically
equivalent
doughnut
altogether
11
holes
like
sphere
endowed
11
torus
like
handlebodies
well
made
congruent
rhombi
thus
monohedral
nice
job
afraid
facing
exercise
find
monohedral
non
convex
polyhedron
genus
11
somewhat
frustrating
experience
quite
number
people
including
geometers
congratulations

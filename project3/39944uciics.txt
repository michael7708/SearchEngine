made

question
posted

couple
years
ago
remained
unnoticed
worst
unanswered
best
every
convex
polygon
projection
polytope
way
polytope's
vertices
become
polygon's
vertices
intersections
diagonals
polytope's
edges
become
polygon's
edges
diagonal
segments
polytope's
faces
become
polygon's
diagonals
regions
save
polytope's
base
whole
polygon
example
lifting

point
quadrilateral's
two
diagonals
vertically
dragging
diagonals
along
get
desired
polytope
pyramid
likewise
lifted
diagonals'
pentagon

us
solve
problem
5
now
clear
hard
generate
desired
polytope
large
preserving
sought
polytope's
planarity
faces
polygon's
linearity
diagonals
projection
arrived
question
became
aware
slick
way
counting
polygon's
diagonals
regions
using
euler's
polytope
formula

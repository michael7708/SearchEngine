transformation
estimate
homography
need
4

points
first
image
example
provided
central
image
simplest
construct
mosaic
central
image
set
peripheral
images
since
need
find
just
one
homography
peripheral
image
use
cpselect
cpcorr
functions
manually
select
refine
least
4
pairs
corresponding
points
overlap
region
central
peripheral
images

located
high

corners
next
compute
homography
using
linear

squares
set
correspondences
provide
mapping

probably
want
write

need
figure

simply

find

final

now
generate
meshgrid
points
cover
mosaic
send

use
interp2
extract

finally
assemble

can
treat

homography
use
'linear'
interpolation
interp2
fast
looks
good
just
make
sure
use
nearest

interpolation
looks

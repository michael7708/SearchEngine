lab
exercise
4
assembling
larger
programs
connecting
outside
world
today's
exercise
previous
lab
exercises
written
programs
perform
variety
tasks
dna
sequences
counting
various
kinds
nucleotides
finding
presence
gaps
determining
presence
absence
start
codons
ultimately
finding
candidate
genes
one
main
goals
first
two
weeks
course
talked
lecture
yesterday
however
programs
limited
usefulness
fact
program's
input
appear
program
better
program
one
can
interact
world
outside
minimum
like
programs
able
take
input
external
sources
human
user
typing
input
program
files
containing
input
even
directly
internet
limited
processing
input
stored
program
ability
makes
programs
much
easier
use
also
makes
much
easier
test
since
can
repeatedly
give
different
input
see
whether
program
behaves
today's
task
assemble
pieces
built
throughout
course
complete
programs
able
get
input
outside
world

today's
problems
today's
problems
focus
taking
existing
programs
built
previously
connecting
input
sources
today
concentrate
two
input
formats
dna

instead
use

candidate
genes
defined
previous
lab
assignment
candidate

gene
codons
previous

also
report

say
something
like

write
program

dna
sequence
input
can
use
previous
programs
find

reverse
complements
report
candidate

way
previous
program
except
sure
note
whether
found
given
reverse
strands
write
program
finds
candidate

dna

rather
reporting
length
strand
codons
translate
candidate

amino
acid

show
complete
amino
acid
sequence
instead
can

perform

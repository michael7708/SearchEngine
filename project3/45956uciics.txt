encountered
significant
bug
today
took
hours
fix
originally
decided
use

performance
reasons
also
happy
bother
object
relational
mapping
unfortunately
however
free
object
database
chose
causing
us
trouble
beginning
finally
decided
throw
use
mysql
luckily
object
database
system
based
standard
java
persistence
api
able
switch
underlying
implementation
mysql
without
needing
change
code
just
add
object
relational
mapping
system
back

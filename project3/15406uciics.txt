cole's
improvement
sorting
based
parametric
search
technique
provides
automatic
way
saving
logarithmic
factor
running
time
optimization
problem
achievable
using
standard
parametric
search
method
unfortunately
improvement
comes
expense
making
already
complicated
algorithm
even
complex
hence
technique
mostly
theoretical
interest
paper
show
asymptotic
complexity
can
achieved
way
simple
practical
suitable
actual
implementation
